# Setting Up Your AWS Account
There are pleanty of docs out there for you to get started. The ones I have put below are there to guide you through some of the steps missed by people as they set up their accounts. 

## Step 1: Create An Account

## Step 2: Now For Account Setup
Select Services -> IAM
Once here you can see five checkboxes, make sure they are all completed before doing anything else with your account

## Step 3: Set Up Billing Alerts
This will show you when you are spending money (or people are spending your money for you)
